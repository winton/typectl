# ðŸš° typectl

TypeScript control flow library

```bash
npm install typectl
```

## Summary

**Typectl** is a control flow library for executing functions and mapping results.

Instead of awaiting function calls, typectl wraps functions so they may optionally receive the promise version of their arguments. Wrapped functions do not execute until their arguments resolve.

With this approach, now you can call all of your functions at once (without await), passing the promise return values to successive calls. The most optimal execution order occurs naturally based on the "race" to run functions pending the resolution of its arguments.

### How it works

1. Wrap any function so it accepts the promise version of its arguments (`wrap`).
2. Pick values from promises without awaiting resolution (`pick`).
3. Execute promised functions concurrently (`all`) or sequentially (`each`).
4. Map promises to arrays, records, and streams (`toArray`, `toRecord`, `toStream`).

### Extras

1. Type-safe â˜”.
2. Elegant dynamic imports âš¡.
3. Universal JS (Node and browser) ðŸ‘½.
4. Small footprint (~1 kb) ðŸ‘£.

## Example

### `fixture.ts`

```typescript
export function time() {
  return new Date().getTime()
}

export function relay(value: number) {
  return value
}
```

### `spec.ts`

```typescript
import { all, pick, each, wrap } from "typectl"
import expect from "expect"

export default async function() {
  const time = pick(import("./fixture"), "time")
  const times = all([time, time])
  const time1 = pick(times, 0)
  const time2 = pick(times, 1)

  const relay = wrap(pick(import("./fixture"), "relay"))
  const relayedTime1 = relay(time1)
  const relayedTime2 = relay(time2)

  expect(await relayedTime1).toEqual(await time1)
  expect(await relayedTime2).toEqual(await time2)
  
  // console.log(await time1, await time2)
}
```
