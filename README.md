# ðŸš° typectl

TypeScript control flow library

```bash
npm install typectl
```

## Summary

**Typectl** is a control flow library for executing dependent functions and transforming return values (without await).

The "killer feature" of typectl is `wrap`. Wrapping a function allows it to optionally receive the typed promise version of its arguments. Wrapped functions do not execute until their arguments resolve.

Wrapped functions return a typed promise version of the original return value. To prepare promise return values for becoming input for another wrapped function, `pick` values out or transform them (without await).

Because you're passing the promise return values to successive wrapped functions (without await), the most optimal execution order occurs naturally based on the "race" to run functions pending the resolution of its arguments.

Function definitions remain simple and reusable by moving more complex synchronicty concerns to control flows. The control flow execution order remains optimized as it scales organically (without much planning).

### How it works

Control flows are similar to a "controller", or a place where other functions are called (potentially to return something). Within your control flow:

1. Wrap any function so it accepts the promise version of its arguments and returns a promise (`wrap`).
2. Pick values from promise return values without awaiting resolution (`pick`).
3. Map promise values to arrays, records, and streams (`toArray`, `toRecord`, `toStream`).
4. Execute promised functions concurrently (`all`) or sequentially (`each`).

### Dev features

1. Type-safe â˜”.
2. Elegant dynamic imports âš¡.
3. Universal JS (Node and browser) ðŸ‘½.
4. Small footprint (~1 kb) ðŸ‘£.

## Example

### `fixture.ts`

```typescript
export function time() {
  return new Date().getTime()
}

export function relay(value: number) {
  return value
}
```

### `spec.ts`

```typescript
import { all, pick, each, wrap } from "typectl"
import expect from "expect"

export default async function() {
  const time = pick(import("./fixture"), "time")
  const times = all([time, time])
  const time1 = pick(times, 0)
  const time2 = pick(times, 1)

  const relay = wrap(pick(import("./fixture"), "relay"))
  const relayedTime1 = relay(time1)
  const relayedTime2 = relay(time2)

  expect(await relayedTime1).toEqual(await time1)
  expect(await relayedTime2).toEqual(await time2)
  
  // console.log(await time1, await time2)
}
```
